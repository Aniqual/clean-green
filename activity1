    <h3>Explanation (≈180 words)</h3>
    <p>
      The rooftop solar PV system uses <strong>sunlight</strong> as the primary energy source. Solar photovoltaic panels mounted on the roof convert sunlight into DC electricity.
      This DC power is regulated by an MPPT charge controller, which optimizes current and voltage while charging a <strong>battery bank</strong> for storage.
      The stored energy passes through a <strong>hybrid inverter</strong> that converts DC to AC for household appliances such as lighting, fans, and kitchen equipment.
      When generation exceeds load demand, surplus electricity is exported to the grid via <strong>net metering</strong>, and during low generation, power is drawn from the grid or batteries.
      Outputs include continuous power supply and reduced electricity bills.
      <strong>Real-world relevance:</strong> A 5 kW rooftop system ensures clean, renewable, and reliable energy for homes. It reduces carbon footprint, enhances energy independence,
      and maintains operation during power cuts through stored energy — a practical solution for sustainable urban living.
